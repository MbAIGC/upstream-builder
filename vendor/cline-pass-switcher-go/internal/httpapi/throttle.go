// A public deployment must not allow unlimited guessing. Attempts that present
// a *wrong* credential are counted per source address; once the limit is
// reached the address is refused outright for a growing cooldown, including
// attempts that would otherwise succeed. That last part is deliberate: rate
// limiting only the *rejections* would still evaluate every guess and hand the
// key to whoever finds it. A request that presents no credential at all is not
// a guess - it is answered with 401 and leaves the counter alone, so a console
// page loading before login cannot lock its own operator out.
//
// Behind a reverse proxy every client arrives from the proxy's address. When
// that hop is the loopback interface or a trusted proxy, its forwarding chain
// names the real client and each client gets its own bucket (throttleClient);
// otherwise - a Docker port mapping without TRUSTED_PROXIES, say - all of them
// share the peer's bucket. The entry map is bounded either way.
